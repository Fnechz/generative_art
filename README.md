# generative_art
Simple unique art generated from periodic math functions using PIL

Be as imaginative as you can and add more functions but be sure to prevent overflow errors due to possoble generation of large numbers from the recursive calls.

There is a simple blendimage.py program that can be used to randomly merge art to produce interesting images

Can you find ways to produce art that can become NFT?

The *img3.png* image above was generated by the following recursive calls:

````
img3:
red = tan(pi*tan(pi*hacoversin(pi*tan(pi*tan(pi*y)))))
green = haversin(pi*sin(pi*haversin(pi*sin(pi*tan(pi*x)))))
blue = sin(pi*haversin(pi*exp(pi*exp(pi*sin(pi*x*exp(pi*sin(pi*x)))))))

`````
You can see all the functions that were generated in the ``` equations.txt ``` file generated by running the file
